## Project description

<p align="justify">

I used Google's layout as a reference, aiming to practice my skills and challenge myself in building interactive interfaces.

This was my first experience with React. I'm pleased with the outcome and looking forward to the next stages of my learning journey.

## Features

- Enjoy a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with an interactive board, allowing players to make their moves by clicking on the board's squares using the mouse.
- Receive immediate feedback on the game's progress through visual indicators that show each player's turn and a score tally that keeps track of all victories.
- Take on the challenge of winning the game by achieving three in-a-row markings, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Additionally, the possibility of a draw exists when neither player completes three squares.
- After each match, easily reset the board to initiate a new game, allowing for multiple rounds of fun.

## Tools used
