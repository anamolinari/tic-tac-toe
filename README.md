## Project description

<p align="justify">
This project aims to create a tic-tac-toe game within a React environment.

I used Google's design and format as a reference, which provided me with a clear template for the game's structure and its functionalities, allowing me to practice and showcase my expertise in building interactive interfaces.

It's important to highlight that this was my first experience with React, and I'm thrilled with the outcome. I'm excited for the next stages of my learning journey.

## Features

<b>Interactive Gameplay:</b> Enjoy a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with an interactive board, allowing players to make their moves by clicking on the board's squares using the mouse.

<b>Real-time Feedback:</b> Receive immediate feedback on the game's progress through visual indicators that show each player's turn and a score tally that keeps track of all victories.

<b>Victory Conditions:</b> Take on the challenge of winning the game by achieving three in-a-row markings, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Additionally, the possibility of a draw exists when neither player completes three squares.

<b>Play Again:</b> After each match, easily reset the board to initiate a new game, allowing for multiple rounds of fun.

## Main Challenges

Throughout the development process, I encountered some interesting challenges:

<b>Learning Animations:</b> An exciting next step is the implementation of animations to enhance the game's visual experience. This will involve hands-on learning of how to create dynamic interactions with players.

<b>API Integration:</b> As a future goal, I plan to integrate the game with an API. This will enable features such as storing updates and tracking game history, adding an extra dimension to the project.
