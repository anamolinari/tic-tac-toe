## Project Description

<p align="justify">

I used Google's layout as a reference to practice my skills and challenge myself in building interactive interfaces.

This was my first experience with React, and I'm pleased with the outcome. I look forward to the next stages of my learning journey.

## Features

- Enjoy a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with an interactive board, allowing players to make their moves by clicking on the board's squares using the mouse.
-  Receive immediate feedback on the game's progress through visual indicators that show each player's turn and a score tally that tracks all victories.
-  Take on the challenge of winning the game by achieving three in a row, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Additionally, a draw is possible when neither player completes three squares.
- After each match, easily reset the board to initiate a new game, allowing for multiple rounds of fun.

## Tools Used
